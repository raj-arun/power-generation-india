### Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation
It is no secret that over the years, India has been investing more in Renewable Sources of energy. Let's take a look at a 4 year time period (2014–2018) to understand the statistics. In this analysis I want to find out the following:
  - Power generation Trend from Renewable sources
  - Various sources of renewable energey used for power generation
  - State wise total power generated from Various Renewable Sources of energy
  - Identify the top 5 - 6 states in terms of power generation from Renewable Sources of Energy
  - Trend of Power Generation from Solar by the top states
  - Trend of Power Generation from Wind by the top states

### Data Files
For this analysis I downloaded the data files from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/sector/power-and-energy) portal offered by the government of India. I downloaded the following files and later combined it into one file. The clean data file can be downloaded from my GitHub repository. 
  - [2014–2015](https://data.gov.in/resources/stateut-wise-power-generation-various-renewable-energy-sources-during-2014-2015-ministry)
  - [2015–2016](https://data.gov.in/resources/stateut-wise-power-generation-various-renewable-energy-sources-during-2015-2016-ministry)
  - [2016–2017](https://data.gov.in/resources/stateut-wise-power-generation-various-renewable-energy-sources-during-2016-2017-ministry)
  - [2017–2018](https://data.gov.in/resources/stateut-wise-power-generation-various-renewable-energy-sources-during-2017-2018-ministry)

##### Use the combined data file *2014-2018 Sources of Energy.csv* for your analysis

### Completed Project File
Use the completed file **Energy Sources.ipynb** to view the final python code.

### Results
